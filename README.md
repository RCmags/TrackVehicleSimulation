# TrackVehicleSimulation
This is a simple 2D simulation of a tracked vehicle composed of two rectangular tracks attached to a central plate. By track we refer to a continous belt that is in contact with the ground (also known as a tank tread). 

Given the track is in contact with the ground over a large area and not concentrated at a single point, the net force and torque generated by each track is computed via numertical integration using simpson's rule. The net forces of each track are then combined under the assumption that the vehicle is a rigid body.

The net force and torque acting on the vehicle are the integrated twice using the trapezoidal rule to find the instantaneous velocity and position. The velocity estimates are then used to calculate next estimate of the track forces in order to generate a new iteration of the velocity and position - Essenstially, a system of ordinary differential equations are solved simultaneously to estimate the state of the vehicle.

These estimates are then fed into a simple canvas animation which is displayed at the end of the program. This animation can then be saved as a video that is created next to the .py file. 

NOTE: This was written in Python 3.
